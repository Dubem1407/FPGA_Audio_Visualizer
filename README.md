# FPGA Audio Visualizer
An FPGA-based real-time audio visualizer project built for the **Altera DE2-115 (Cyclone IV E)** board.

This project is designed as a portfolio and skill-building exercise to demonstrate HDL design, simulation, timing management, and FPGA-based signal visualization.  
Development is done using **Quartus Prime** and **Questa** for simulation.

---

## Project Goals
- Strengthen skills in **SystemVerilog** design and simulation.
- Implement an **audio visualizer** pipeline:
  - Audio input capture
  - Processing and amplitude visualization
  - LED or HEX display output
- Practice project version control and documentation using **GitHub**.

## Tools & Environment
- **Board:** Altera DE2-115 (Cyclone IV E)
- **HDL:** SystemVerilog
- **Toolchain:** Quartus Prime (Lite Edition) & Questa (Intel FPGA)
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Documentation:** Markdown (`docs/` folder)
