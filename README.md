# FPGA Audio Visualizer

## OVERVIEW
The FPGA Audio Visualizer is a real-time hardware system that analyzes incoming audio signals and visually represents them using LEDs or a VGA display. The system captures audio data, processes it to extract amplitude or frequency information, and then drives visual outputs that respond dynamically to the music or sound intensity.

This project demonstrates key skills in digital signal processing, real-time hardware design, SystemVerilog programming, and hardware-software integration. It combines analog interfacing, timing control, and modular design principles to implement a fully functional embedded visualizer on an FPGA board.

The project built for the **Altera DE2-115 (Cyclone IV E)** board.

Development is done using **Quartus Prime** and **Questa (ModelSim)**.

##  Phase 1: Setup and Environment Verification

**Goal:** Establish a functional baseline for Quartus, simulation, and board connectivity.

### Tools
- **Intel Quartus Prime (Lite Edition)**
- **Questa (ModelSim)**
- **FPGA Board:** Altera DE2-115 (Cyclone IV E)
- **Programmer:** USB-Blaster

### Planned Tasks
- Install and configure Quartus Prime (Lite Edition) and Questa  
- Verify board detection via USB-Blaster  
- Run a simple LED blink demo  
- Create clean directory structure for source, simulation, and documentation files
